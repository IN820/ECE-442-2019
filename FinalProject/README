As the final project of ECE 442, the purpose of this project is to utilize the knowledge of the
embedded system to build a smart system. As per the design instruction, the system should
consist of a raspberry Pi, a single board computer, a server, and several types of sensor.
According to the requirement of the design project, I chose to build a smart home automation
system. Along with Raspberry Pi, the microcontroller is chosen to use ESP8266 due to its WIFI
feature. The server in this project is set to use HomeAssistant (HA). HomeAssistant is an open
source server that is designed to be applied to smart home automation, which is very suitable
for this project.
At the beginning of this project, the design only had a simple light control and a door alarm.
After the initial build was finished, I added more features including manual control state, more
sensor, e-mail alert, etc to the system. All the data will be send through communication protocol
to the HA server and the server can keep log of the changes of every sensor and light.
----------------File Description------------------
Main.py
