In this lab problem, we will be introduced to implementing temperature sensing system using
LM35 temperature sensor wired to the Arduino UNO board. The sensor data will be transmitted
to Raspberry Pi using Bluetooth module connected on Arduino board. Then the data will be
retransmitted to ThingSpeak â€˜s channel and draw the chart using real-time data.
